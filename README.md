# Mathematica-K3ygen

This is an adaptation of the Wolfram Mathematica keygens found on some websites like ibug's, but written in Python. The advantage is that Python is a "simple" language, we won't need a browser or npm to run the script. Everything is done with "standard" libraries like math and random. Additionally, the code is accessible for anyone. I I decided to upload this here because I couldn't find a functional keygen written in Python or anything similar, and it's the language I usually use.
