# Mathematica-Keygen

> [!Warning]
>This project is an activation key generator for Wolfram Mathematica adapted from the JS script of ibug.io; its use is not promoted in any way.

This is an adaptation of the Wolfram Mathematica keygens found on some websites like ibug.io, but written in Python. The advantage is that Python is a "simple" language, we won't need a browser or npm to run the script. Everything is done with "standard" libraries like math and random. Additionally, the code is accessible for anyone. I decided to upload this here because I couldn't find a functional keygen written in Python or anything similar, and it's the language I usually use.

To use it, you only need to run the script and enter your WolframID, which can be obtained in the "Other ways to activate" and "Manual Activation" sections. The script will provide the necessary data for activation. If none of the 5 keys work for you, just run it again to get different ones. However, it usually works on the first try.
